# Real Estate Visual Quality AI

This project presents an intelligent system for evaluating and improving the visual quality of real estate interior images using computer vision techniques.

## Project Objective
To design and implement an AI-based system capable of:
- Analyzing interior property images
- Scoring their visual quality
- Providing objective improvement recommendations
- Applying light automatic image enhancements

## Scope
This project focuses on visual quality assessment only.  
It does NOT perform property valuation, price estimation, or image manipulation that alters the real characteristics of the property.

## System Architecture
The system is composed of:
- A mobile frontend application
- A backend API developed in Python
- Computer vision and machine learning models for image analysis

## Technologies
- Python
- FastAPI
- OpenCV
- React Native (frontend)
- GitHub for version control

## Academic Context
This project is developed as part of a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data.
